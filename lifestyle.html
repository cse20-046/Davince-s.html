                <h1>BUNGEE JUMPING</h1>
                <p>Orlando Towers in Soweto, Johannesburg calls itself a vertical adventure centre, and it’s hard to argue with that description. They offer bungee jumping, climbing, abseiling, rap jumping, and swinging. The Towers, with their eye-catching paintings, were once part of one of the most advanced power stations in the southern hemisphere. They no longer function as a power station, but with all their exciting offerings there is still electricity in the air!</p>

                <h1>INCREASE IN CRIME</h1>
                <p>Yet crime in the area is on the increase, and rates of burglary, robbery and assault are high. Contrary to popular perception, crime here is not committed by foreigners or by people from other parts of Soweto or Johannesburg. Rather, victims and nonvictims alike believe that crimes are committed by people living in Meadowlands – largely young people and the unemployed.

                <h1>FAVORIATE DISHES</h1>
                <p>When visiting South Africa there are many dishes one should try, however, there are a few that will stand out and which you will really need to try before you go home.There is boerewors a typical South African sausage often packed as a continuous spiral,bunny chow often known as 'kota' consists of a hollowed out quarter or half loaf of bread filled up with a tasty Indian curry made from beans or meat (mutton, beef or chicken). The bread is used as a dish to hold the curry.</p>

The national rugby team is nicknamed The Springboks. South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the first one hosted in Africa.

                    Cricket is traditionally the popular sport among the white British diaspora and Indian South African communities, although it is now followed by members of all races. The national cricket team is nicknamed The Proteas.
                    
                    Soccer has historically been particularly popular amongst persons of African descent and is South Africa’s most popular sport. The South Africa national soccer team, Bafana Bafana, has not enjoyed considerable success since the early 20th Century.</p>
