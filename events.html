                <h2>SOWETO SPIN CITY</h2>
                <p>The crowd gathers and grows, cars parked in a circle to create a stage for the spinners. The anticipation intensifies and regular attendees reminisce about past spectaculars, burst tires and flaming exhaust pipes (apparently a good thing) achieved by the spinning crews as they slowly arrive, each introducing their presence with loud music and an engine purr as scary as it is exhilarating.
